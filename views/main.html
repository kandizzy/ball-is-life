I built a Lunar lander style HTML5 game using the Phaser framework. It was part of a recent installation by Faile at the Brooklyn Museum. Here is a photo I took a photo of some museum guests playing the game.

I spent a day pair programming a way to render Yorgo's After Effects videos to LED matrixs for some cool effects. The setup featured a network of 20 raspberry pi's, multiple arduinos and tons of LED's and circutry to program visually.

##### Our own exploration in LED Sculpture and Programming
We love LED's and programming them. These are our first attempts at a bigger scale installations. On the LED wall we were up for two weeks hand soldering over 3000 LED's. We managed to hit our installation deadline and carried our setup over to the proposed space. During installation we fried one of our Atmega's and didn't have a backup. We had to abort mission. Next time!</script> <script type="text/ng-template" id="Opensource.md">---

#### Nike Finishline Interactive Wall

###### Client: Nike
###### Role: Technical Director
###### Agency: STEADY
We had the opportunity to design the digital strategy for brand new Nike Track prototype store. 

We customized a shoe wall with interactive iPad apps in which the users can learn more about the products in-store. We also installed a mutliscreen reactive and eventually gesture enabled interactive video wall.

There are so many great videos from this install it was hard to just choose a few.

###### Client: Tourneau
###### Role: Technical Director
###### Agency: STEADY

Large touchscreens were installed in select Tourneau retail locations across North America to expose the full collection of CPO watches to potential customers.

The screens' content is powered by a autonomous backend that retrieves daily inventory updates from Tourneau's inventory system and feeds the updates to the onsite applications without any human interaction. Within the Middleware component, internal Tourneau can rank/prioritize the associated watches, change their display views and assign location specific idle loops promoting new/seasonal CPO inventory.

#### GT/Cannondale Sales Books

###### Client: Cannondale
###### Role: Technical Director
###### Agency: STEADY

The idea behind this iPad app was to replace the hundreds of bike spec sheets that would have to be printed and handed out to all attendees. Instead, an iPad, pre-loaded with the GT Sales App was given to all the distributors. The app featured digital versions of all the bike spec sheets powered by a custom CMS.

This app has been used repeatly to refresh inventory for the past few years.</script> <script type="text/ng-template" id="vogue_wish_list.md">---

An image recognition iOS app and companion web site. You could take a picture of any page in the current issue of Vogue and the app would recognize it and display additional content if available. A custom CMS was built to associate pages with content.</script> <script type="text/ng-template" id="steady-labs.md">---

<p>The Kinect had just come out and we really wanted to use it. Our first experiments led to creating a system within openFrameworks to build interactive apps. We learned a massive amount - and were able to use the same setup in all the retail projects we deployed after this R&D.

#### Nike HOI

###### Client: Nike
###### Role: Lead Creative Developer / Designer
###### Agency: Honest

During the 2008 Olympics, Nike produced a gallery show in Beijing and a related book commemorating their many technological and cultural acheivements called ’100 Artifacts from the Battle Against the Drag’. When they decided to add a web counterpart, they turned to Honest. Our challenge was how to combine elements of both the book and the show into one seamless interactive experience.


The solution was to work with Immersive Media, the company that created Street View on Google Maps, and employ their video technology in a way that had never been attempted before. Visitors to the Nike HOI site are literally able to ‘walk through’ the exhibition, “looking around” a full 360 degress, and click on the artifacts (which have been mapped onto the 3D space via Papervision) for more information. In the Book section, they can even flip through all 100 Artifacts to get even deeper into what made these items so important to Nike’s development.</script> <script type="text/ng-template" id="uglydolls.md">---

#### Make It Your Own
---

###### Client: Nike
###### Role: Technical Director
###### Agency: STEADY
This retail installation consisted of custom built software that allowed users to add customized text and art work to Nike apparel. We built a 3D software that ran on large format touchscreens. Customers could design their shirt which was then sent to another application we built that sent the artwork to a garment printer.

This was installed in select Nike locations across the US. When the design was finished on the kiosk we sent an upload to Flickr as well as sending it to the printer. A nice collection of what people made can be [seen here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nikeatfinishline).

#### TECHNE! EYEBEAM RESIDENCY PROPOSAL
---

In this application for a residency at Eyebeam I proposed an light installation using robotic arms. Unfortunately, it was not accepted for the round, but I will continue refining the concept and apply again. I also began to learn a bit more about [robotics](http://ckisadj.com/i-bought-a-robot-arm/). Here is an excerpt from my application:
> 
> During this residency my main goal would be to build an interactive installation. The aim of the project is to create an infinite feedback loop between the viewer, machines and other participants in the environment.
> 
> The idea is to have groups of lights networked with a computer and various sensors that use computer vision to determine nearby activity. Each group of lights has an emotional characteristic such as shyness, curiosity, or loneliness. They will display different behavior according to how they “feel”. For example, if a large number of people are close to the ‘shy’ lights it would cause them to turn away and dim, but when people move a certain safe distance away the lights turn forward and brighten changing colors.
> 
> The aim is to communicate recognizable emotions through mechanical responses using visual sensory input. Changing color, brightness, and intensity of light in the room will affect the participants and their movement will affect the machines.
