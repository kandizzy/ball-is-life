# THINGS I MAKE, THINGS I LOVE

I work with code.

I've worked at big agencies and small, I am currently the Technical Director at [STEADY](http://www.steadyltd.com). In my off time I work on projects driven by passion, mostly under the moniker [justpitbulls](http://justpitbulls.org). 

My work includes interactive experiences for mobile, web and public spaces. I explore, practice, design, build, repeat. Here are a few of my favorite projects.
