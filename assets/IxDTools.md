## Interaction Design Tools for Brands
##### Clients: GT Bikes + Cannondale, Tourneau Retail, Vogue, Nike All-Star
##### Role: IxD, Information Architecture, Angular Development
##### While working with Steady LTD, we had a series of design challenges ahead of us at built a few tools along the way to help us with the process.


####GT+Cannondale
<p> We worked with GT and Tourneau to re-architecture their inventory system and created a way for them to manage their projects and events via CMS. The CMS also powered a campanion iPad (built by @jawngee) and in-store touch screen apps which was shipped internationally to vendors. </p>

####Vogue Wish List
<p>We also learned very quickly, no matter how cool the tech is... if people don't know how to use it or don't want to, it won't shine. We didn't get as much usage as we hoped.</p> 

<p>Vogue Wishlist featured an intense backend and RANSAC image recognition/matching system built by @mikemanh. We worked on the front-end iPhone dev. App was designed to be paired with Semptember issue launch of Vogue. We scanned all 700+ pages of the magazine for our image matching.</p>

####Social Media Walls
<p>We designed a series of 'Social Wall' type projects for Nike products and events. To provide content for these various installations; We built a few social tools to parse #Nike social media data. Users can take photos at the event and view them real-time on the giant displays.</p>
