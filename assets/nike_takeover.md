We had the opportunity to design the digital strategy for brand new Nike Track prototype store. 

We customized a shoe wall with interactive iPad apps in which the users can learn more about the products in-store. We also installed a mutliscreen reactive and eventually gesture enabled interactive video wall.

There are so many great videos from this install it was hard to just choose a few.
