<p>What we learned: We can push boundries and make things work in a short time frame. Our project in the end was installation failure. Maybe we didn't see it properly through until the end.  On the positive end we were able to develop a display tree in openFrameworks and release it open source after the project ended. We even had some people fork it! </p>
