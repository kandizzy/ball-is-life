This retail installation consisted of custom built software that allowed users to add customized text and art work to Nike apparel. We built a 3D software that ran on large format touchscreens. Customers could design their shirt which was then sent to another application we built that sent the artwork to a garment printer.

This was installed in select Nike locations across the US. When the design was finished on the kiosk we sent an upload to Flickr as well as sending it to the printer. A nice collection of what people made can be [seen here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nikeatfinishline).
