##### Our own exploration in LED Sculpture and Programming
We love LED's and programming them. These are our first attempts at a bigger scale installations. On the LED wall we were up for two weeks hand soldering over 3000 LED's. We managed to hit our installation deadline and carried our setup over to the proposed space. During installation we fried one of our Atmega's and didn't have a backup. We had to abort mission. Next time!
