Large touchscreens were installed in select Tourneau retail locations across North America to expose the full collection of CPO watches to potential customers.

The screens' content is powered by a autonomous backend that retrieves daily inventory updates from Tourneau's inventory system and feeds the updates to the onsite applications without any human interaction. Within the Middleware component, internal Tourneau can rank/prioritize the associated watches, change their display views and assign location specific idle loops promoting new/seasonal CPO inventory.
