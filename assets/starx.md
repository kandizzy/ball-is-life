An exploration in LED Sculpture, Experimental Real-Time Communication and Product Design. 

This is a new work in progress and collaboration with Bruno Kruse spanning timezones in NYC/China.

Our first idea aims to be a screenless communication device between small groups of people. Our project will take the form of a web-enabled ‘smart light’ style device that displays messages in colors and patterns in a beautiful way. Think of the little notification LED that pulses and changes colors on your smart-phone. Simple and out of the way.

The difference between our project and other ambient/smart light devices is our focus on human communication. The other 'ambient light' products in the market now are controlled by data streams from machines. They are one-off representations of data and are reactive to the web and not interactive between people.
