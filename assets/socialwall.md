###### Client: Nike

###### Agency: STEADY

The social wall project combined a social media scraping tool, a custom CMS for curating the content, and a resizable openFrameworks application that could be run on multiple monitor configurations. It was installed at the Super Bowl, the NBA All Star game, the Nike Women's Half-Marathon among other locations and still runs 24/7 in the [Nike Running Flatiron store](https://vimeo.com/99367907).
