#### TECHNE! EYEBEAM RESIDENCY PROPOSAL
---

In this application for a residency at Eyebeam I proposed an light installation using robotic arms. Unfortunately, it was not accepted for the round, but I will continue refining the concept and apply again. I also began to learn a bit more about [robotics](http://ckisadj.com/i-bought-a-robot-arm/). Here is an excerpt from my application:
> 
> During this residency my main goal would be to build an interactive installation. The aim of the project is to create an infinite feedback loop between the viewer, machines and other participants in the environment.
> 
> The idea is to have groups of lights networked with a computer and various sensors that use computer vision to determine nearby activity. Each group of lights has an emotional characteristic such as shyness, curiosity, or loneliness. They will display different behavior according to how they “feel”. For example, if a large number of people are close to the ‘shy’ lights it would cause them to turn away and dim, but when people move a certain safe distance away the lights turn forward and brighten changing colors.
> 
> The aim is to communicate recognizable emotions through mechanical responses using visual sensory input. Changing color, brightness, and intensity of light in the room will affect the participants and their movement will affect the machines.
